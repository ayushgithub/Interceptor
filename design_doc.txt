Database Container
* Simple python based application that will generate a time series data for a specified starting time and a given amount
* Will follow a simple build process
   * Make builds the docker image and put it in a dist folder, with support to check if the image is already present then skip
   * Make clean removes this dist folder
* We will use a simple python native http webserver that will accept two query parameters, “start_time” & “duration”. The server will return data for the same
* It will be running on port 9000


Client Container
* Simple python client that will interact with the sidecar proxy called proxy_server
* Interaction is over simple http get request with parameters as
   * service_name - service to forward the request to
   * Key worded params that will be passed to the service as it is
* It will be running on port 8080


Interceptor
* This will be a simple http proxy server built using native python http.server
* As the client interacts with interceptor and hostname of the service is abstracted away from the client, we need python kubernetes client support for finding the respective service for the given service_name which is supposed to a label.
* It will be responsible for calculating latency and flagging late responses to the stdout
* It will be running on port - 8000
